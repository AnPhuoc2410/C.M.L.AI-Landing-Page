# Contradiction 4.0 - Interactive Marxist Theory Game

## Overview
**Contradiction 4.0** is an educational minigame that explores Karl Marx's theory of dialectical materialism through interactive gameplay. The game simulates the clash between new AI-based productive forces (Lực lượng sản xuất - LLSX) and outdated relations of production (Quan hệ sản xuất - QHSX).

## Game Concept
Players navigate through three historical societies where advanced AI technology disrupts traditional economic structures:

1. **Feudal Farm** (Medieval Era)
   - Traditional agriculture meets AI-powered automation
   - Players must decide how feudal lords should respond to revolutionary technology

2. **Early Capitalist Factory** (Industrial Revolution)
   - Steam-powered factories face AI automation
   - Explore the contradictions between worker exploitation and technological advancement

3. **Modern Tech Company** (Digital Age)
   - Platform capitalism meets advanced AI
   - Navigate surveillance capitalism vs. cooperative ownership

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Loop
1. **Introduction Phase**: Learn about the current society and its production relations
2. **AI Introduction**: Advanced AI arrives and dramatically boosts productivity
3. **The Contradiction**: Witness the clash between new productive forces and old social structures
4. **Decision Point**: Choose how to resolve the contradiction:
   - **Keep Old System**: Maintain existing power structures (usually triggers revolution)
   - **Partial Reform**: Implement moderate changes (creates unstable transition)
   - **Cooperative Ownership**: Adapt relations to match productive forces (achieves harmony)

### Mentor Marx
Throughout the game, "Mentor Marx" provides:
- Contextual hints about each society's contradictions
- Famous quotes from Marxist theory
- Post-decision analysis of your choices

### Scoring System
- **Stability Points**: Each decision affects societal stability (-70 to +80)
- **Outcome Tracking**: Success, Revolution, or Transition
- **Final Analysis**: Overall verdict based on cumulative choices

## Educational Goals

The game teaches:
- **Base and Superstructure**: How economic base determines social/political structures
- **Dialectical Materialism**: Contradictions drive historical change
- **Historical Materialism**: Society evolves through stages based on productive forces
- **Class Struggle**: Conflicts between those who control production and those who work
- **Revolutionary Change**: When contradictions become unbearable, social revolution occurs

## Technical Implementation

### Built With
- **React 19**: Modern hooks and component architecture
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and transitions
